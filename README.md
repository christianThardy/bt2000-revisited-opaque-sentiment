# BT2000 Revisited for Opaque Sentiment Analysis, ASR & NLG using Transformers and RLHF

This repo is home to a web app that was built with respect to a blog post sharing the same title as this readme. The speech-to-text app classifies sentiment and returns dialog or a suggestion for a user's input sentiment. The sentiment classifier was trained on the blues traveler 2000 dataset, automatic speech recognition is handled by OpenAi's Whisper and natural language generation is handled by fine-tuning OpenAi's GPT-3 Da Vinci-003 model.
